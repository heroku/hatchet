module Hatchet
  # This class lazilly deletes hatchet apps
  #
  # When the reaper is called, it will check if the system has too many apps (Bassed off of HATCHET_APP_LIMIT), if so it will attempt
  # to delete an app to free up capacity. The goal of lazilly deleting apps is to temporarilly keep
  # apps around for debugging if they fail.
  #
  # When App#teardown! is called on an app it is marked as being in a "finished" state by turning
  # on maintenance mode. The reaper will delete these in order (oldest first).
  #
  # If no apps are marked as being "finished" then the reaper will check to see if the oldest app
  # has been alive for a long enough period for it's tests to finish (configured by HATCHET_ALIVE_TTL_MINUTES env var).
  # If the "unfinished" app has been alive that long it will be deleted. If not, the system will sleep for a period of time
  # in an attempt to allow other apps to move to be "finished".
  #
  # This class only limits and the number of "hatchet" apps on the system. Prevously there was a maximum of 100 apps on a
  # Heroku account. Now a user can belong to multiple orgs and the total number of apps they have access to is no longer
  # fixed at 100. Instead of hard coding a maximum limit, this failure mode is handled by forcing deletion of
  # an app when app creation fails. In the future we may find a better way of detecting this failure mode
  #
  # Notes:
  #
  # - The class uses a file mutex so that multiple processes on the same machine do not attempt to run the
  #   reaper at the same time.
  # - AlreadyDeletedError will be raised if an app has already been deleted (possibly by another test run on
  #   another machine). When this happens, the system will automatically attempt to reap another app.
